          I am a Front-end Developer with a passion for modern technologies and
          I specialize in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and other MERN
          Stack technologies to create interactive and scalable web
          applications. I am currently seeking new opportunities to collaborate
          and contribute to innovative projects.

          I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills and am able to
          work well both individually and in a team. Iâ€™m a lifelong learner
          currently learning MaterialUI, Next.js, Socket.IO, and TypeScript. In
          my free time I love playing football, reading books, and cycling.
